**Description ---**

Developed a database application in MS Access to analyze the Airbnb market and real estate sales. Eight raw datasets
from Excel were analyzed, cleaned, and integrated into eight comprehensive tables.
Used SQL queries, forms, and macros to create a user-friendly rental application in MS Access. An MS Access file is being developed for an Airbnb app that allows customers to input their criteria, 
such as preferred location, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and total rooms. 
Based on these preferences, a list of matching properties is displayed. Once a customer selects a property, their details are added to the system.

Designed and deployed Power BI dashboards providing in-depth revenue, utilization, and analysis over four years.
